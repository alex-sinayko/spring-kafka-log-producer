# Simple Log Forwarding Service

This is a lightweight service built with **Spring Boot**, designed to forward logs to a **Kafka** topic. It is ideal for
scenarios where you need to reliably send application logs to a robust messaging system for further processing.

## Key Features

- **Log Forwarding to Kafka**: The service pushes logs to Kafka topics, providing a decoupled logging mechanism for
  better scalability and reliability.
- **Dynamic Log Level Configuration**: The configuration includes `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*`,
  enabling access to Spring Boot's Actuator endpoints via REST. This allows you to dynamically adjust the logging levels
  without restarting the application.
- **Convenient Log Level Management**: For enhanced usability, the service
  utilizes [Ostara](https://github.com/Trendyol/ostara), a tool designed to simplify log level adjustments within
  distributed applications.

## How It Works

1. Logs are collected and forwarded to a configured Kafka topic.
2. Logging levels can be adjusted in real-time via the `/actuator/loggers` endpoint (exposed by Spring Boot Actuator).
3. Ostara acts as an additional abstraction, enabling simplified log level management through a centralized or
   user-friendly interface.

## Why Use This Service?

This service is built to facilitate seamless integration with modern logging architectures. By leveraging the power of
Kafka for log handling and exposing Spring Bootâ€™s Actuator capabilities for configuration management, it ensures your
application's performance and observability requirements are elegantly met.

For more details about the capabilities of Spring Boot Actuator, refer to
the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html).
